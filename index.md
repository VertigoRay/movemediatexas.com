# Soon

A simple *coming soon* page built for [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/).

## What's in it?

A single static page with a full screen image. Remember those *under construction* sites? The point is to have a contact page for a few hours or a few days while you are building your amazing site.
